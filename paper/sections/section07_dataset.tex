\section{Dataset}
For training and testing our deepfake detection model, we used \textbf{FaceForensics++} dataset. This dataset is well-known in the deepfake detection community for their high-quality video manipulations and diverse forgery techniques, making them ideal for evaluating the model's performance under real-world conditions.
\subsection{FaceForensics++} \textbf{FaceForensics++} is a comprehensive dataset that contains manipulated facial videos and provides a benchmark for both video and image-based forgery detection. It is widely used for training and evaluating deepfake detection models, including various forgery types such as deepfakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, and NeuralTextures. This dataset offers a comprehensive benchmark for both image and video forgery detection models and serves as a cornerstone for evaluating the robustness of deepfake detection methods.
